    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>For the past 10 years I have been working
        with customers in a few different scopes,
        thanks to which I learned to be more
        communicative, organized and with good
        level of self-confidence. On my current
        position I managed to develop skills
        regarding the responsibility in the
        assignments, good sense of time management
        and performance under pressure to meet the
        deadlines. I’m good in dealing my
        assignments by myself, as well as working in
        a team.</p>
        <p>Lately, I decided that it’s time to make a new path
        in my career and point myself to the Front-End
        development, as I have always been
        interested in the user experience and design
        sphere.
        In the last year I have passed several
        academic courses in JavaScript, HTML and
        CSS, as well as in the QA testing.
        My experience in the sphere is basic and non-
        company level, so I’m seeking for making a
        professional debut and develop my skills in
        that direction as an Intern/Junior developer.</p>
